# Nation-Park-Weather

Build an application using grunt to get data from the following API: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nss-day-cohort-31/national-parks/master/database.json.

Display the list of national parks on the DOM.

If the park has been visited, the article tag should have a red dashed border. If the park has not been visited, it should have a green solid border. For each of the national parks, use the latitude and longitude to get the weather.
